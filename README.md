# Mewt

Mewt is a chatting app like telegram but with additional features like translate message and send money with bank transfer to your contacts.

Mewt is still in the development phase and will be launched first for Android. The app can be downloaded free of charge from the respective store of your smartphone OS.

As mentioned above, the app should have extra functions such as a text translator in the chat area. There will also be a group function with a sub function called Group Trip so that friends can organize their trips from there.

So that this app can also earn money in order to continue to grow, there should also be a function in the app called Send Money, with this function it should be possible for users to send money to their contacts, whether bank transfer or Paypal. For the Paypal money transfer it should work normally like with every Paypal transfer, i.e. from Paypal account to Paypal account. With the bank transfer, however, the money should be transferred via a specially set up bank account from Mewmotion, this money being used to protect the customer's data. The transfer should look like this: "UserA sends money to UserB, money is transferred from UserA to Mewmotion and then paid directly to UserB's account with communication "UserA Mewt". With this transfer, for example, UserA cannot see UserB's bank account number and UserB does not have the bank account number of User A. With every transfer, 0.10€ go to Mewmotion as a transfer service, there should be a limit of 1000€ as a transfer and an annual limit of 5000€.

Mewt is developed by Mewmotion, but we welcome contributors who want to work with us on the app, all contributors will share in Mewt's profits.
